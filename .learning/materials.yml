      One of the difficult parts of collaboration is dealing with merge
      conflicts. Never fear, though! In this repository, we'll walk through how
      to resolve one such conflict.

      The basic idea is to practice accidentally deleting one of our local
      branches (which I've done a few times), and then finding it again in the
      reflog. Scary, right! I used to think so, but don't worry...the reflog can
      help us.

      Rebasing is scary for people. We need to practice it to feel less scared.
      Practicing with immediate actionable feedback could help this process.

      Have you ever wondered about the deep git magicks...?
      Have you ever heard about git's ability to delete a file across the entire
      git history in a recursive rebase-like fashion...?
      Have you ever been reading the ancient scrolls late at night, and come
      across the git filter-branch command...?
