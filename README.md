# Setup Instructions

This is the seed template for your very own learning space. All you need to do
is use this template to generate your own repository, and the github action will
do all the work of setting up the readme with steps for your learning journey!

## Getting Started

1. Click the "Use Template" button on the upper right hand corner of this page.

4. To generate your learning path, go to the "Actions" tab and click on "I
   understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them".
